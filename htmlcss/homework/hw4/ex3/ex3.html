        <p class="card__text">
          World-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a
          cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist. What he discovers is unimaginable: a deadly
          vendetta against the Catholic Church by a centuries-old underground organization -- the Illuminati. In a
          desperate race to save the Vatican from a powerful time bomb, Langdon joins forces in Rome with the beautiful
          and mysterious scientist Vittoria Vetra. Together they embark on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts,
          dangerous catacombs, and deserted cathedrals, and into the depths of the most secretive vault on earth...the
          long-forgotten Illuminati lair.

        <h2>The Da Vinci Code</h2>
        <p class="card__text">
          Harvard professor Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call while on business in Paris: the
          elderly curator of the Louvre has been brutally murdered inside the museum. Alongside the body, police have
          found a series of baffling codes.
          As Langdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, begin to sort through the bizarre riddles, they are
          stunned to find a trail that leads to the works of Leonardo Da Vinci - and suggests the answer to a mystery
          that stretches deep into the vault of history.
          Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine code and quickly assemble the pieces of the puzzle, a
          stunning historical truth will be lost forever...

        <h2>Inferno</h2>
        <p class="card__text">
          In his international blockbusters The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons, and The Lost Symbol, Dan Brown
          masterfully fused history, art, codes, and symbols. In this riveting new thriller, Brown returns to his
          element and has crafted his highest-stakes novel to date.
          In the heart of Italy, Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon is drawn into a harrowing world centered
          on one of history’s most enduring and mysterious literary masterpieces . . . Dante’s Inferno.
          Against this backdrop, Langdon battles a chilling adversary and grapples with an ingenious riddle that pulls
          him into a landscape of classic art, secret passageways, and futuristic science. Drawing from Dante’s dark
          epic poem, Langdon races to find answers and decide whom to trust . . . before the world is irrevocably
          altered.
